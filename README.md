# Audity
An iOS app that uses the Spotify API to simplify listening to audiobooks. 


This is an ongoing project built with Swift5 with the ultimate goal that the user will be able to bookmark his/her progress when listening to audiobooks. 

When it's finished it will fetch tracks and artworks from the Spotify API, let you add audiobooks to your library, and shows progress indication and also remembers where you left off.
